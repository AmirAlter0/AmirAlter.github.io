      # Ethical Guidelines

      We consider the effects of our choices with regarding to running our service. We follow a privacy-first mindset that goes beyond the basics.


      Every decision matters: how and what we communicate to new customers, what information we collect and what tools we use to improve our service.

      We believe in leading by example, and commit to the following:

      #### No trackers

      Trackers by ad companies and social networks monitor your actions and aid in profiling you. You won’t find them on ivpn.net - we are a tracking free provider.

      #### No third-party tools

      Tools like Google Analytics collect personally identifiable information. We use software hosted only on IVPN controlled servers to ensure your privacy.

      #### No secrets

      IVPN’s ownership structure and team is public, so you know who is responsible for protecting your privacy.

      #### No false promises

      Some services try to convince everyone to get a VPN and become anonymous online. We don't advertise benefits that are not attainable by using a VPN.

      #### No paid reviews

      We have closed down our affiliate program to protest against the practice of paid reviews and misleading recommendations by "best VPN" websites.

      ## How we attract new customers

      We are committed to spreading the word about IVPN’s mission and help more people protect their privacy. Utilizing free and paid channels to reach new audiences is part of this process.
      

      We consider marketing methods that are misleading or use personal profiling harmful, and refuse to engage in them. For this reason, we shun behavioral advertising that uses data collected in ways you might not know about and don't advertise on Facebook and Google properties.
