# What is a Multi-hop VPN service?

When connecting to a Multi-hop server, instead of your traffic being routed through a single VPN server, it is routed through two VPN servers. This technology has been carefully incorporated into the IVPN network using the same 256-bit OpenVPN encryption as the single-hop VPN servers. Multi-hop connections offer significantly higher levels of anonymity and privacy, however, they are slightly slower than single-hop connections due to the additional hop that your traffic is routed through. We offer our customers a choice of single and Multi-hop connections for OpenVPN.

Multi-hop is available on IVPN Pro accounts and is currently limited to OpenVPN connections.
