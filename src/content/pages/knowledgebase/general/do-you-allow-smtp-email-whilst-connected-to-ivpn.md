# Do you allow SMTP (email) whilst connected to IVPN?

We do allow SMTP traffic to be sent through our servers. As this opens up the possibility to spam millions of people from behind our IP's we've had to implement various non-invasive controls to mitigate this threat.

As a normal email user, none of these controls should affect your ability to send emails. However, if you are a bulk email marketer, then these controls will likely block your SMTP connections.
