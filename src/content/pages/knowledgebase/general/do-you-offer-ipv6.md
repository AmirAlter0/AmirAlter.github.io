# Do you offer IPv6?

Not yet, but we are currently testing various solutions. We have successfully configured test OpenVPN servers to provide IPv6 connectivity to customers (6in4) but we are still exploring the requirement for native IPv6 connectivity on our servers.

Very few customers at this point have native IPv6 connectivity from their ISP. OpenVPN is also set for a big rewrite of it IPv6 code in the 2.4 release. This will be necessary for a good implementation, the progress of OpenVPN 2.4 can be tracked [here](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/milestone/release%202.4).

Please follow our [Blog](/blog/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ivpnnet) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IVPN) page for updates on IPv6.
