# Can I access Hulu / Netflix / BBC iPlayer using IVPN?

A VPN service can be used to not only protect your privacy but also to gain access to services not available in your current location, such as Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, BBC, Disney+ and so on.

However, IVPN is focused specifically on protecting the privacy of our customers and although many customers do use IVPN to access these services we make no guarantee about the availability of these services when connected to our network.

<div markdown="1" class="notice notice--warning">
Most streaming services are currently on an active campaign to block all VPN and Proxy connections. They are targeting massive amounts of IPv4 addresses at this time. Due to the exhaustion of the IPv4 space and strict registrar reporting requirements, it is quickly becoming impossible to get around this block.
