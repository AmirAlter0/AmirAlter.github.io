# Do you offer Two-Factor Authentication?

Yes, and it can be easily enabled in just a few steps:

<div markdown="1" class="notice notice--warning">
Note, 2FA adds an additional authentication step to the Client Area on our website, not IVPN apps.
</div>

1. Login to your [Client Area](/account/login/)

2. Navigate to `Account settings` and check the `2-factor authentication` checkbox.

3. Scan the barcode using the preferred TOTP app (Time-based One-Time Password), e.g. **Google Authenticator**.

4. Enter the generated 6-digit code and click on the `Enable` button to confirm the 2FA activation.

5. Store **Backup Codes** you will see on the next page somewhere safe - it can be used to disable the 2FA in the future.
