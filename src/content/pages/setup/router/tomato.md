## Tomato Router Setup Guide

Our service is compatible with routers running Tomato firmware. However please note:

1. If you do not already have a compatible router or do not wish to risk bricking it, IVPN has partnered with [FlashRouters](http://www.flashrouters.com/routers/vpn-types/ivpn/) to offer you a variety of custom-built routers specially configured for IVPN. We receive no commission from sales but we highly recommend them as they have the expertise to support Tomato with its constantly evolving firmware and associated bugs.
2. If you already have a router FlashRouters offer [support plans](https://www.flashrouters.com/services/support-plans) where they will remotely install the correct firmware on your router and configure it to connect to our VPN service.
3. We do not provide support in getting Tomato firmware installed on your router. We take no responsibility if you brick/damage your router in the process.
4. Please ensure that you are using the latest version of the Tomato firmware.
